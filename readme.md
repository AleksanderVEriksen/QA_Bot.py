# QA bot with LangChain and RAG utilizing WatsonX

This Capstone project is done regarding the IBM specialization course AI engineering at Coursera. For this project, I learned how to load different types of documents, embed them, store them in a vector database, and then use a retriever to get information based on user-defined queries. This implementation takes a given PDF and store it into a vectordb, where the retriever can get relevant information based on a query from the user.

## Gradio Interface
The implementation uses gradio to easily create an easy-to-use interface.
